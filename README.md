  development with 2 systems: *headless frontend* (Unity), and *BFF* (Backend For Frontend, term from webdev but it's wide meaning) makes isolate cosmetic logic and game system logic.
- on-the-fly editing: keeps play mode while development iteration (as much as possible). reduces to annoying repeat play/stop and compile time.
